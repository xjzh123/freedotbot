Freedotbot is a bot for hack.chat. 
This project refers to foolishbird by Light a little, but is not based on it. 
This programme can be used as a hack.chat client, for it has a more nice-looking web UI made with PyWebIO than UI made with Tkinter. 
For the time being, it has few bot features, but is can connect hack.chat and have space to extend. 
procfile and main.sh are not ready for heroku/railway.app. dotbot can't run in heroku/railway.app at present.
