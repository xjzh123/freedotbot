Freedotbot is a bot for hack.chat. 
This project refers to foolishbird by Light a little, but is not based on it. 
This programme can be used as a hack.chat client, for it has a more nice-looking web UI made with PyWebIO than UI made with Tkinter. 
For the time being, it has few bot features, but is can connect hack.chat and have space to extend.
